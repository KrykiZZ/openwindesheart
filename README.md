# OpenWindesheart

The open-source OpenWindesheart is a library used for scanning, connecting and getting data from activity-trackers using bluetooth.

## Support

This project has been created by students of Windesheim University of Applied Sciences and does not guarantee any support in the future. 

This library uses the [ACR Reactive BluetoothLE Plugin](https://github.com/aritchie/bluetoothle) to do anything BluetoothLE related. Our project only supports versions that are supported by this library, because our project depends heavily upon it.

The features have been tested with Android/iOS phones in combination with the Mi Band 3/Xiaomi Band 3.  

## Features

* Scanning for BLE devices
* Pairing with a BLE device
* Connecting to BLE device
* Reading current battery-data and status
* Reading current step-data
* Reading step-data from the past days
* Reading heartrate after measurement.
* Reading heartrate from the past days with measurement-intervals
* Reading sleep-data from the past days
* Setting step-goal on BLE device
* Setting language on BLE device
* Setting Date and time on BLE device
* Setting Date-format and Hour-notation on BLE device
* Toggle screen of BLE device on wrist-lift
* Auto-reconnect after Bluetooth-adapter toggle
* Auto-reconnect when within range of BLE device
* Disconnect with BLE device

## Supported Devices

At this moment the OpenWindesheart library only fully supports the Mi Band 3. 

The library is designed in a way that other devices can be added easily. If you want to add support for a device, please check out our documentation: [How to add support for a new device](https://github.com/ictinnovaties-zorg/openwindesheart/blob/master/README-SupportNewDevice.md)


### Mi Band 4
If you want these features with a Mi Band 4, then you will have to get the authentication-key for your Mi Band here:
https://www.freemyband.com/2019/08/mi-band-4-auth-key.html

We have a branch for the Mi Band 4, called MiBand4, which allows these devices to show up in the list of scanned devices.

To make your app work with our logic, please update line 13 of this file: https://github.com/ictinnovaties-zorg/openwindesheart/blob/MiBand4/WindesHeartSDK/Devices/MiBand4/Helpers/MiBand4ConversionHelper.cs 

This is where you fill in your own secret key. For example; the key '0a1bc2' should be altered to {0x0a, 0x1b, 0xc2} in the byte-array on line 13 of the code.

After that, you will only have to build the SDK and the mobile-project. 
Once all is built, it should be ready for use with the Mi Band 4.

## SETUP  
1.  Clone this repository into your solution and manage a dependency from your mobile-project to this one.  
2.  Carefully read the docs for implementation of different features. For a working example, have a look at the Xamarin Forms project on this page.
3.  Implement the features in your mobile-application the way you want them!

## Credits

We would like to thank Allan Ritchie for creating the [ACR Reactive BluetoothLE Plugin](https://github.com/aritchie/bluetoothle). Without this open-source library our project would not have been finished within the specified amount of time.
